Do you think that Expert Mode is too hard but still want a challenge? Are Normal Mode bosses too boring?
Then this mod is probably for you! Boss Expertise makes bosses behave like they're in Expert Mode, even though their stats don't change.
BossExpertise also adds some optional features (like bosses dropping Treasure Bags in Normal Mode), which are disabled by default.
Also allows you to toggle Expert Mode via chat command (/expert), Cheat Sheet or HERO's Mod.

Big thanks to Pop000100 for maintaining the mod.
